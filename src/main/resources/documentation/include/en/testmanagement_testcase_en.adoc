==== Test Case attributes
|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Test Folder | *[red]#Test Folder#* name on which test case belong.

| Test case | An ID (alphanumeric character) that identify the *[red]#Test Case#* inside the *[red]#Test Folder#*.

| Short Description | Provide a brief description of the *[red]#Test Case#*.

| Application | The application for which the test case is defined.

| Status | Used to implement a workflow and gives way to filter *[red]#Test Case#* depending on its implementation status.

| Active | Boolean that defines if the *[red]#Test Case#* can be launched.

| Type | define the technology of the application (Web, IOS, Android, service,...).

| Priority | Defined the priority of the *[red]#Test Case#*. Means importance of the feature covered by the *[red]#Test Case#*.

| Detailed Description | Provide more detailed information about the *[red]#Test Case#*.

|=== 

The Activation Criterias defines condition to enable/block the Testcase to be launched in specific context (countries, environment...). This level of specification is the most important (override all the others conditions)

A Test case can be linked to multiple Labels depending on their assigned system (see labels section)

You can define Robot constrains at test case level in order to force the execution a specific test case with a specific UserAgent or ScreenSize.
This is used to test some specific behavior of a website for a given UserAgent or ScreenSize.
You can tune the list of UserAgent and ScreenSize proposed in autocomplete mode (on the GUI) by modifying the respective public invariant USERAGENT and SCREENSIZE.

UserAgent and ScreenSize will be defined at execution level following the rule :

|=== 

| *TestCase* | *Robot / Execution* | *UserAgent Result*   
| UserAgent1 |	| UserAgent1
|  | UserAgent2 | UserAgent2
|  |	| user Agent unchanged
| UserAgent1 | UserAgent2 | UserAgent1

Your step is created. if you want to put it in library, just click on the book on the right side.
A step in library will be available to add it in all test cases of your current system.

image:testcasesteplibrary.png[testcasesteplibrary]

In the following screenshot you can see a use step. This step is imported from the previous library step.
You are not able to modify it (all fields are grey). But you can find a link at the top to open the library if you want to modify your step. All use steps from this library will be impacted by your modification.

To modify only this use step, you have to click on the padlock icon but it will not be a use step anymore. (modification on library step will not affect it)

=== TestCase Action Global Informations

==== Global Identifiers Definition

Syntax in order to identify a field or element inside a page has the form :

identifier=html_reference

identifier can take the various values :

 - id= 

id of the field will be used.

 - name=
 
 - class=
 
 - css=
 
 - xpath= 
 
You can specify an xpath value. Additional documentation on xpath syntax can be found https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp[here].
Xpath can be tested live on Web pages from Chrome Developer extention (accessible via F12).

Via Element tab, you just have to hit CTRL+F in order to find inside the DOM.

==== FAT client Applications

In order to perform any action/control (e.g. 'click', 'verifyElementPresent'), Application Object must be used to reference picture. 
Keep in mind that for click action, it will be performed in the center of the picture:

==== Network Traffic JSON format

Standard JSON format can by found in  https://w3c.github.io/web-performance/specs/HAR/Overview.html[w3c repo].

In addition to standard HAR structure, Cerberus will add a `stat` json entry in top level containing some agregated data in order to make controls easier. That `stat` section will be feed by checking every hit performed by the tested application. Every hit will enrish the `total` section (excepted ingnored entries that will feed `ignore` section). They will also feed one of the following section : either `internal`, either  `thirdparty` (each will then be spread per thirdparty `ThirdPartyN`) or `unknown` if the hit cannot match one of the application domain or one of the Third Party domain.

    }

Cerberus will determine if a hit must be ignored (and appear in *[blue]`ignore`* section) by feeding parameter `cerberus_webperf_ignoredomainlist` with coma separated domains to ignore.

Cerberus will get and guess the `ThirdPartyN` from *[blue]`thirdparty`* section from a json file that can be retrieve from the following https://github.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web/blob/master/data/entities.json5[repo].

The file should be available from Cerberus from the location provided by the parameter `cerberus_webperf_thirdpartyfilepath`.

If parameter is empty or file not found by Cerberus, no third party will be guess.

You can also add extra third party from the Cerberus GUI by adding a public invariant `WEBPERFTHIRDPARTY` with first attribute with the list of domain with coma separated format.

*[blue]`internal`* section is populated from the URL domain list defined on the corresponding application / environment. all hosts should be defined on the domain field with coma separated format. In case the domain field is empty, Cerberus will guess it from the application URL.

Any host URL that does not match either the `cerberus_webperf_ignoredomainlist` parameter, the ThirdParty definition file from parameter `cerberus_webperf_thirdpartyfilepath`, the `WEBPERFTHIRDPARTY` public invariant or list of application domain will appear in the *[blue]`unknown`* section.

At the end of the execution, Cerberus will automatically execute 'waitNetworkTrafficIdle' action in order to secure that requests are no longer performed. This is used in order to secure that the collected stats are complete and does not miss some important hits.

=== Test Case Property

When clicking on Tab image:buttonmanageproperties.png[buttonManageProperties], the Property menu will appear.
From there you can manage your TestCase properties or see your Inherited Properties - coming from the step libraries of your use steps.

image:windowmanageproperties.png[windowManageProperties]

Properties are the key element of your Test Case to manage different variables in the same scenario. A property is identified by its name and the country for which it's defined (e.g. you cannot have two properties defined for the same country with the same name).

Properties can be called by their name using the following syntaxes:

- `%property.property_name%` : the execution will **stop** if any problem in the property calculation
- `%property_name_here%` : the execution will **not stop** if any problem in the property calculation

When handling Datalib, the syntaxes to call the subdata are :

- `%property.property_name.sub_data_name%` or `%property_name.sub_data_name%`
- `%property.property_name(sub_data_name)%` or `%property_name(sub_data_name)%`

Properties can be called in action or control values field or in another property.

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Property | Name of the property.

| Description | Description of the property.

| Countries | Countries for which the property will be calculated (environment parameter).

| Type | The way the property is going to be calculated.

| Value | Value of the property.

| DB | DataBase in which the property will be calculated. Used by "executeSql" Property type.

| Length | When calculating a list of values, defines the number of rows the property will return.

| Row Limit | When returning a list of values, limits the number of rows the property will consider for random purposes.

| Nature | Defines the unique value that will be used in the execution. By default, STATIC has no rules defined : it will take the first result it finds. RANDOM will pick a random value if several rows are available. RANDOMNEW will pick a random value that was never selected before in any older execution. NOTINUSE will pick a value that is not currently used by a running execution.

| Nb of retry | When the property fail to retrieve any data, it can retry several times to get the data. That data define the nb of retry after which it will stop trying and report a NA status.

| Retry Period | Defines the period in millisecond between every retry.

| Cache Expire | Defines the amount of time in second during which the property can be kept in cache. 0 value disable the cache mecanisme.

| Rank | If 1 the property is considered as a primary property and will always be displayed on execution detail. From 2 to higher value, the property will be considered as secondary and will be hidden by default from execution report.

|=== 

==== Property Types

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description* | *Example*  

| text | assign the property an alphanumeric value. Can invoke other properties | `%system.EXECUTIONID%_test`

| getFromDataLib | query the corresponding datalib (identified by its name) | `Datalib_Name`

| getFromSQL | run a specific query an get the first, and only the first, result. The DB must be specified | `select TestCase from testcasestepactioncontrol where Control = 'verifyElementInElement'`

| getFromHtml |  | 

| getFromHtmlVisible |  | 

| getElementPosition |  | 

| getFromJS | Execute the specified JavaScript script without getting any output | `var xPathRes = document.evaluate ("//*[@data-cerberus='button_basket_ProductBloc_modifyProduct1']", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null); xPathRes.singleNodeValue.click();`

| getAttributeFromHtml |  | 

| getFromCookie |  | 

| getFromXml | Xpath to get a certain element from an XML service call | `//OrderId/text()`

| getDifferencesFromXml |  | 

| getRawFromXml | Xpath to get a certain element from an XML service call | `//OrderId/text()`

| getFromJson | JSON path to get a certain element from a service call | `$.status`

| getFromCommand |  | 

| getFromGroovy | Execute the specified Groovy script and get the last defined variable | `'%property.date%'.replace('\','-').substring(0,10)`

|===

===== SQL queries management:

- queries can be stored inside the test case and launched using getFromSQL. Only one value of the first row can be retrieved.

- queries can be stored inside a Datalib, according to its DB. Several values of the first row can be retrieved.

We recommend to use the Datalib since it allow SQL to be dynamically reused from one test case to another.

=== Test Case Variables

You can use variables in many area of Cerberus. Those variable are used in order to perform some actions of controls in a dynamic way.
3 types of variables can be created :

- Variables defined from **properties** inside Test Cases.
- Variables defined from **application object**.
- **System** Variables

Properties and Application Object are defined by the users while system variable are provided by Cerberus.

The global syntax of a variable is :
%[property|object|system].nameOfTheVariable%

This is the list of fields in Cerberus where you can use those variables.

- All Test Cases, Steps, Actions and Control descriptions.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Step Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Action Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Control Test Case level.
- Test Case Action Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Test Case Control Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Test Case Properties Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.
- Path, Envelope and Method at Test Data Library (SOAP) level.
- SQL Script at Test Data Library (SQL) level
- Column, Parsing Answer and Column Position at Test Data Library Subdata definition level
- Path, Request, Operation and Attachment URL at Service level.
- Request detail (all keys and values) and Header (all keys and values) at Service level.

When a variable is detected in one of those field, Cerberus will replace it by the value during the execution.

- If the variable is an object, the value (that never change) is just replaced.
- If the variable is a system variable, the value is calculated and replaced at the same time (for ex : time defined by %system.TODAY-doy% will be the day and time of the replacement).
- If the variable is a property, it gets automatically calculated at the time of the replacement. If it was already calculated before, the same value (already calculated) is replaced.
NOTE: In order to force the calculation of a property at a certain timing, _calculateProperty_ Action can be inserted just before the action is used in a field.

Variables can be defined in a recursive way.
That means that the following syntax :

%property.%system.country%% will be first replaced by

%property.FR% and then by FR property value (if it exist).

Please note also that, if at the end of the decode operation, there are still references to %property.???% or %system.???% or %object.%%% in the field, the corresponding test case will report an error and generate an FA status.

==== Property Variables

Property variable allow to have multi row content.
As a consequence the full syntax will look like this :

%property.NameOfTheVariable.rowNb.SubData%

If rowNb is not defined, the 1st row will be used. As a consequence, the syntax %property.rowNb.nameOfTheVariable% is the same as %property.1.nameOfTheVariable%

If SubData is not defined, the key value subdata will be used.

==== Object Variables

- %object.myobject.value% : Get the application object myobject's value
- %object.myobject.picturepath% : Get the application object myobject's picture path
- %object.myobject.pictureurl% : Get the application object myobject's picure url

==== Tricks

You will find below some tricks which help you to implement specific test cases.

NOTE: It is possible to create a random property with a number of digit defined. You have to feed the property fields like the screenshot below. This property will be different for each execution. Example: 884592, 004795
